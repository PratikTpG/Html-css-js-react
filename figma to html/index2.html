                Welcome To Our Site</h1>
                <br>
            <p>I am Ben Carling, the owner and head coach at Sports Performance Services Ltd, based in Douglas, Isle of
                Man. After studying business management, I decided embark in a career that was also a passion of mine;
                health and fitness. I had played sports from an early age so it seemed a natural thing to do. I became a
                qualified Personal Trainer, and latterly an accredited Strength and Conditioning coach with the UKSCA.
                Currently there are only 4 accredited coaches in the Isle of Man, and circa 600 in the UK.
                <br>
                As well as private work, I work at the Isle of Man Sport Institute. I work with a wide cross section of
                athletes from different sports, from field based sports such as football, rugby and hockey to individual
                sports such as archery, sailing, tennis, motorsport and swimming. I am proud to have played my part in
                helping these athletes set personal bests, Island records and some that have gone on to achieve
                scholarships or youth contracts at professional level.
